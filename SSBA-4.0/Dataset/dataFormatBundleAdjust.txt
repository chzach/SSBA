This is the general format for data input for bundle adjustment: 

	First line: 
		<numPoints> <numCams> <num2Dmeasurements>

	Second line (intrinsic matrix):
		<focalXdirect> <skew> <cx> <focalYdirect> <cy> <k1> <k2> <p1> <p2>

	Following lines (numPoints):
		<uniquePtId> <xCord> <yCord> <zCord>

	Lines Following (numCams): 
		<uniqueViewId> <12RTparameters(Row Major, left to right)>

	Lines Following (num2Dmeasurements): 
		<uniqueViewId> <uniquePtId> <camera2DxCord> <camera2DyCord> <1>

There is an commented accompanying data set.
